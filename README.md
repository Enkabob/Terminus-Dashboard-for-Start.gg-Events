## 🛠️ Developer Setup (Source Code)

Only follow these steps if you want to modify the code or build the app yourself.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Enkabob/the-terminal.git
cd Terminus-Dashboard-for-Start.gg-Events
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure API Token
You need a Start.gg Auth Token to fetch data.
*   **Dev Mode:** Create a `.env` file in the root: `VITE_STARTGG_TOKEN=your_token_here`
*   **Production:** The app will prompt for a token or requires hardcoding in `App.jsx` before building.

### 4. Running the App
*   **Web Mode:** `npm run dev`
*   **Desktop Dev Mode:** `npm run electron:dev`
*   **Build .exe:** `npm run dist`

## 🧠 The "Deep Knowledge" Filter

To prevent the dashboard from getting cluttered with "TBD vs TBD" matches, this app uses a strict validation algorithm:

1.  **State 1 (Open):** ALWAYS SHOWN. These are playable matches.
2.  **State 5 (Pending):** ONLY SHOWN if we have "Deep Knowledge" of both sides.

**What is Deep Knowledge?**
*   **Level 1 (Entrant):** We know the player's name. (e.g. "Mang0") -> **VALID**
*   **Level 2 (Resolved Prereq):** We know the *two specific players* fighting in the previous set. (e.g. "Winner of Mang0 vs Zain") -> **VALID**
*   **Level 3 (Mystery):** We do not know who is fighting in the previous set. (e.g. "Winner of Winner of Bracket A") -> **HIDDEN**

## 📦 Tech Stack

*   **Core:** React (Vite)
*   **Desktop Wrapper:** Electron & Electron Builder
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (v4)
*   **Data:** GraphQL (Start.gg API)
